# Tailwind CSS: Unexpected Responsive Behavior with Container and Grid

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to Tailwind CSS's `container` class and its interaction with responsive grid layouts.  The issue arises from the default responsive nature of the `container` class, which might cause unexpected reflows and layouts across different screen sizes if not properly handled.  The provided code showcases the problem and a suggested solution.

## Problem

The main issue is that the `container` class is designed to provide a responsive width based on the screen size, this can lead to problems when the layout includes a responsive grid as the columns might not always align or the layout might break unexpectedly on certain screen sizes.

## Solution

The solution is to manage the responsiveness more explicitly.  Using the `max-w-screen-xl` utility class, we set a maximum width to prevent the container from taking up the full screen width on larger screens. This is especially beneficial in preventing horizontal overflow on larger monitors. If it is desirable to have the container take up the full width at the largest screen sizes, then this solution will not be necessary.  Alternatively, one could use media queries or other responsive techniques to explicitly control the grid layout's behavior at different breakpoints.
